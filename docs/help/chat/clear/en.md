# /chat clear

Clear the entire chat history between you and SoruSora.

If you want to partially delete the chat history, simply delete the Discord message you want to delete. Then the chat history will be truncated from that message.

If you edit the message instead, the chat history will truncate from the edited message and a new response will be generated from the edited message.
