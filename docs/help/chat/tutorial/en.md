# /chat tutorial

Teach you how to chat with SoruSora.

To chat with SoruSora, either mention her in your message or reply to her message. You can also attach images to the message to send them to her. She will reply to you in a few seconds.

Use `/chat clear` to clear the entire chat history between you and her. If you want to partially delete the chat history, simply delete the Discord message you want to delete. Then the chat history will be truncated from that message. If you edit the message instead, the chat history will truncate from the edited message and a new response will be generated from the edited message.
