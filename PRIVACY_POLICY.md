# Privacy Policy

Last updated: Sep 5, 2025

SoruSora (“we”, “our”, or “the Bot”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights when using the bot.

## 1. Information We Collect

We may collect the following information to make the bot work properly:
* Discord User ID – required for personalized commands or features.
* Server ID – to store server-specific settings.
* Messages – the bot can read messages in servers only for translation and AI companion purposes.

We do not collect:
* Your email, password, or other sensitive personal information.
* Private conversations (DMs) unless you directly interact with the bot there.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use collected data to:
* Provide features such as translations and AI-based responses.

For the AI companion feature:
* Message content is not stored in the database.
* Only message IDs are saved so that content can be dynamically fetched from the Discord API.
* Fetched message content is kept temporarily in RAM for processing and discarded afterward.

We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties.

## 3. Data Storage
* User IDs and Server IDs are stored securely on our server.
* Message content is processed in real time and not stored long-term, except when temporarily stored in RAM for AI/translation purposes.
* We retain data only as long as necessary for the bot’s operation or as required by law.

## 4. Your Rights
* You can request to have your data deleted by contacting us at: `contact@seoulsky.dev`
* You can also revoke the bot’s access by removing it from your server.
  
## 5. Third-Party Services

The bot may use third-party libraries or APIs (e.g., Discord API, AI/translation services). These services may have their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for their data handling.

## 6. Security

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, but we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. Any changes will be reflected in this document. Continued use of the bot constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 8. Contact Us
If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, contact us at:

By using **SoruSora**, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to this Privacy Policy.
